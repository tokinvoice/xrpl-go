  - Ensures SignerQuorum is only included in the Flatten() output when explicitly defined.

- Added `RippledAPIV1` and `RippledAPIV2` constants.
- Added missing `ctid` field on `TxRequest` v1 query.
- Added missing `NoRippleCheck` query (v1 & v2 support).

### Changed

- RippledAPIV2 is set as default API version. Queries and transactions are now compatible with Rippled v2 by default. V1 is still supported. In order to use v1, you need to use the `v1` package of each query type.

## [v0.1.2]

### Fixed

#### xrpl

- The `InfoRequest` for the `account_info` method had an incorrect field `signer_list` (an `s` was missing). The correct field is now `signer_lists`.
